# Synapse Lab Setup

You'll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)!

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Use the **[\>_]** button to the right of the search bar at the top of the page to create a new Cloud Shell in the Azure portal, selecting a ***PowerShell*** environment and creating storage if prompted. The cloud shell provides a command line interface in a pane at the bottom of the Azure portal, as shown here:

    > **Note**: If you have previously created a cloud shell that uses a *Bash* environment, use the the drop-down menu at the top left of the cloud shell pane to change it to ***PowerShell***.

3. Note that you can resize the cloud shell by dragging the separator bar at the top of the pane, or by using the **&#8212;**, **&#9723;**, and **X** icons at the top right of the pane to minimize, maximize, and close the pane. For more information about using the Azure Cloud Shell, see the [Azure Cloud Shell documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview).

4. In the PowerShell pane, enter the following command to clone this repo:

    ```
    git clone https://git.com/GraemeMalcolm/synapsestuff
    ```

5. After the repo has been cloned, enter the following commands to change to the **setup** folder and run the **setup.ps1** script it contains:

    ```
    cd setup
    ./setup.ps1
    ```

6. When prompted, enter a suitable password to be set for your Azure Synapse SQl pool.

    > **Note**: Be sure to remember this password!

7. Wait for the script to complete - this can take 15 minutes or so.
